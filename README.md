# UFOs
We are creating a HTML page to display data as a table with filters included using JavaScript.

The goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, we need to build the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

The first attempt of the page was quite simple and did not attract attention. Visitors to our page will want to see some images.
