# UFOs
We are creating a HTML page to display data of UFOs sightings as a table with filters included, using JavaScript.

The goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, we need to build the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

## The first attempt of the page was quite simple and did not attract attention. Visitors to our page will want to see some images.

## So we make some changes:

## And we added some more changes, like adding some filters to improve access to information. So now, all the visitors can access the information either by country, state, date and even the shape of the UFO.

## Now to refresh the page and clean the search engines, you just have to "click" in the upper left corner, just in UFO Sightings

# LetÂ´s try it!

# Instead, El Cajon, California has had more sightings.

# If we filter by shape, we can find sightings of fireballs!

# Recomendations:

1. Add to each filter a dropdown menu to see possible filter values. For example, the usuer would not know that there are UFOs in the shape of fireballs unless the user scroll down the table. Which makes the search tedious and makes the filter function outdated. The same applies for the city and date filter. The Country filter could be removed as there is only one value, US; By removing a filter that doesn't work, you improve the user experience.

2. People who search for UFOs webpages mostly want to see the photos or video. Diplaying a gallery with some photos woulde be a plus.

3. Making case sensitivity or mispell sensitivity can throw to misinformation; so to give a better experience, avoid it.

4. The refresh or clear filter button should be under the filters, to facilitate the new search to the user.

5. About the script for index.html, it's very easy to get lost with the syntax, so keep track of changes by updating the html shell and saving the process frequently.
